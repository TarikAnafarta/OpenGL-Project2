# OpenGL-Project2
Requirements:

A meaningful text for the game and the student’s name should be displayed in the title of the window. Screen design should contain at least 3 areas: gaming area, remaining time, and key functions:

Gaming Area: A weapon object should be placed on one side of the gaming area (top, down, left, or right). On the other half of the gaming area, 5 target objects should move in the direction of up-down or left-right.

Remaining Time: The remaining time should be displayed on the screen.

Keys: Keyboard directives should be displayed.

Design a weapon object (gun, cannon, knife, dart, etc.) that can be moved only on one axis (x or y). It should be moved within the limits of the window.

Design a target object (ship, airplane, bird, etc.). There may be a maximum of 5 target objects on the screen at a time. They should be created automatically on one-half of the gaming area and should come from one side of the screen and move
toward the other side. They should not be shown on the screen with a predefined pattern. They should be displayed in random locations.

The weapon can be fired by pressing the SpaceBar. Its bullet, cannonball, etc., should animate on the screen. You can implement constant speed, constant acceleration, free fall, or projectile motion for the bullet’s movement. If the bullet hits
one of the targets, the target object should be removed from the screen.

The remaining time should be displayed on the screen.

The user should be able to pause and play the game using the F1 key.

The game should continue for 20 seconds. After pressing the F1 key, a new game should start.

Do not create a window larger than 1280 x 960 pixels.
